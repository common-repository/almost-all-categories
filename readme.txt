This widget will let you display a category list in your sidebar, excluding any categories that you would like.

== Description ==

Just a little widget that adds in some useful functionality that WordPress (oddly enough) doesn’t include stock … listing almost all of your categories. Say, for example, you have a utility category entitled “Events,” and you want to display a list of all your site’s categories, but don’t want “Events” to display in that list. Instead of hard-coding a list into a text widget, just use this!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the file `widget_almost_all_categories.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Position the widget in the desired sidebar through the `widgets` admin page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WordPress doesn't let you do this?  Really? =

Well, not through a simple interface like this.  It lets you do it through code in the back-end, but this is a simple wrapper to enable using it in your sidebar.
